CaseStory-1:
Rastogi is a newbie journalist who has just completed his graduation and got a job in one of the premier National Daily News Channel.He was assigned to the Analytics Division of his News Channel where his first assignment is to categorize the comments/tweets on the upcoming Assembly elections. He is given a dataset and the Consulting Editor asks him to make a detailed report with a pictorial presentation so that he can run that as a sensational issue in the Prime Time. Thus, Rastogi goes through the dataset provided to him, he initially finds it difficult but he could hardly categorize the comments/tweet into different categories as they are very random in nature. The dataset contains about 20,000 rows which makes him uneasy to read all of them as they are all vulgar/profanus in nature secondly he is not able to decide how to categorize or divide them into domains based on their severity. 

Thus, this application/interface would easily fit up Rastogiâ€™s expectations. As the outcome is based on displaying the data ( in the form of comments) splitting into a different category based on the severity of the toxic comments. This model is built upon a dataset which has a similar context as mentioned above. Thus, this project would not only hep Rastogi to analyze and provide detailed information about the toxicity in the comments at the same time the integration in Tableau makes it easier to draw pictorial understandings from the outcome gained from the model. Thus, at large he will be in a good position to serve a suitable solution for the problem and also can choose a pool of variations from Tableau which will be euphorically serving his needs and save his time and resources.
